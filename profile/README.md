## 🎯 Problem Statement

Pet owners in Pakistan face significant challenges in their daily lives while managing pet-related activities:

- ❌ **Fragmented Market** – Reliance on scattered Facebook groups, WhatsApp chats, and random online posts
- ❌ **Unverified Information** – Misleading listings with no trust or verification
- ❌ **No Centralized Health Tracking** – Missed vaccination schedules and medical history on paper/phone notes
- ❌ **Difficulty Finding Services** – No reliable way to find trusted boarding or veterinary services
- ❌ **Disconnected Purchasing** – Multiple websites or local stores with no centralized payment option

## 🚀 Continuous Integration (CI/CD Pipeline)

We have configured a complete **GitHub Actions CI Pipeline** in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](file:///.github/workflows/ci.yml) to automatically validate pull requests and branch contributions.

### Workflow Jobs
1. **Linting Check**: Runs ESLint and OxLint across backend server, web frontend, and React Native mobile codebases to enforce quality standards.
2. **Testing Suite**: Installs dependencies and runs unit tests (`Jest` for backend/mobile app, `Vitest` for web frontend) with coverage outputs. Passed environment parameters are injected securely via GitHub Actions secrets (`MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`).
3. **Build Verification**: Validates production compiles (`npm run build` for React web client and `npm run build` for React Native Expo app client).

### Team Contribution Rules
* **Required PR Checks**: All Pull Requests targeting `main` or `master` branches must pass the CI checks before merge approval.
* **Cache Optimization**: Node modules dependencies are cached globally in GitHub runner storage using dependency lock keys to minimize build times.
